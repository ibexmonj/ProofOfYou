# ProofOfYou — Personal API (v0.1)

**Thesis:** ProofOfYou is a personal API ecosystem. Structured, verifiable data — /rules + /contributions — hosted by you, not a platform.
Your work, your context, your domain.

- Landing page: [https://proofofyou.com](https://proofofyou.com)
- Endpoints: [rules.json](https://proofofyou.com/rules.json) · [contributions.json](https://proofofyou.com/contributions.json)
- Schemas: [rules.schema.json](https://proofofyou.com/schema/rules.schema.json) · [contributions.schema.json](https://proofofyou.com/schema/contributions.schema.json)

**Why:** Reduce bias, increase clarity, and maintain ownership by hosting your own data.

**MVP:** Static files + GitHub Pages. Fork, edit JSON, publish.
